# LaptopBatteryStateNotificator
Pops up a notification window when: 

1. When your battery is bellow or at 30% and it's not charging.
2. When your battery is at 100% and it's charging.

I made this tool for laptops with windows 10 which doesn't receive 
the usual battery notification pop up at all or when it's too late.
